# ShelterSync
Project for docusing hackathon 


ShelterSync is a platform powered by DocuSign APIs that streamlines the process of connecting homeless individuals to shelter, food, healthcare, and job resources. It creates an end-to-end digital workflow that integrates data 
from different nonprofit systems to ensure faster resource allocation and better collaboration between organizations.
